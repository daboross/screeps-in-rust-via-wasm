//! Screeps object wrappers.
//!
//! # Unsafe traits
//!
//! This module contains a number of unsafe traits. Each is unsafe purely to
//! prevent accidental implementations on things which don't uphold the trait
//! contracts that have not been put into code. There is no unsafe code
//! in this crate which relies on these traits being implemented correctly,
//! only code which will panic if they are not.
//!
//! Even though this crate does not contain any, other crate unsafe could
//! rely on these contracts being upheld as long as JavaScript code does not
//! do anything mischievous, like removing properties from objects or sticking
//! unexpected things into dictionaries which we trust.
